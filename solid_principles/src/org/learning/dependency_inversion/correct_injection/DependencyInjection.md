#### Dependency Injection
what have we done: <br>
* The __InjectionDemo__ class injects the __ProductRepository__ dependency into the __ProductCatalog__ class
* The __ProductFactory__ is the factory method responsible of instantiating the __SQLProductRepository__
* The __ProductCatalog__ class need not worry about the __ProductRepository__ or about the implementation of the __ProductRepository__.
